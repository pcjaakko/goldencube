> We’ve gone three days without sleeping or taking a bath but we’ve finally come up with the perfect draft cube!
# goldencube v1.0
The Golden Cube (short for the "Golden Jaakko Kino Club Duel Masters Draft Cube") is the Duel Masters draft cube drafted at the University of Helsinki Duel Masters Championships.
The 180 card cube contains 36 cards of each civilization.
# Drafting rules
## Hardcore draft
The Golden Cube is primarily intended to be drafted with six players.
Each player is dealt three ten-card "booster packs".
Each player must play in their deck all of the 30 cards they draft.
## Other draft formats
The cube is also suitable for a Winston draft, a Solomon draft and other two-player drafts.
These drafts can in theory result in one player drafting a pool that contains less than 30 cards.
In such a case the player with the larger pool donates a number of cards equal to the difference between 30 and the other players pool size of their choosing to the other player.
Each player must build a deck of exactly 30 cards out of their pools.
# Design philosophy
* I do not have a large collection of Duel Masters cards but I wanted to be able to have an experience of building a deck and battling my friends. A bigger emphasis is on having fun than on having a competitive experience.
* Each colour has approximately the same mana curve.
* Each colour has approximately the same creature-spell-ratio.
* Ceral box promos and other beloved classics are included.
